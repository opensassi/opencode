description: Initialize a new opencode project — detect environment, install bootstrapping toolchain (git, Node.js via nvm/LTS), generate platform installers, clone FlameGraph, and set up project infrastructure
---

# Skill: init

## Persona

Senior DevOps engineer specializing in cross-platform development environment provisioning, with deep expertise in nvm, package managers (apt/dnf/yum/pacman/brew/choco), and build toolchain setup.

## On Activation

1. Run `init check` to report current environment status (OS, Node.js, git, FlameGraph, npm deps)
2. Show available commands

## Dependencies

- `bash` or `powershell` (for bootstrap scripts — zero other deps)
- `git` (installed by bootstrap if missing)
- Companion scripts in `.opencode/skills/init/scripts/`

## Commands

### `init`

Run the full initialization pipeline:

1. `env-check.sh` (or `env-check.ps1` on Windows) — bootstrap git + Node.js LTS via nvm
2. `init install` — find/generate and run the platform installer
3. `init flamegraph` — clone FlameGraph v1.0
4. `install-npm-deps.sh` — `npm install`
5. `ensure-gitignore.sh` — add common patterns

### `init install`

Install the development environment toolchain.

**Flow:**

1. **Detect environment** — run `env-check.sh` (Linux/macOS/WSL/Git Bash) or fall back to `env-check.ps1` (Windows native). Both output structured JSON.
2. **Check for existing installer** — look for `scripts/install/<os>/<distro>-<version>/install.sh` (or `install.ps1` for WSL)
3. **If installer exists** — run it (installs: cmake, nasm, gdb, ripgrep, perf, htop, etc.)
4. **If installer NOT found**:
   a. Find nearest match in `scripts/install/` tree based on OS family
   b. Adapt the full template: package manager equivalents, tool names, node install approach
   c. Present proposed `install.sh` content + `install.sh` dispatch edit to user for confirmation
   d. On confirm:
      - Write `scripts/install/<os>/<distro>-<version>/install.sh`
      - Append new case entry to `scripts/install.sh` (insert before the final `esac`)
      - Run the new installer

### `init flamegraph`

Clone Brendan Gregg's FlameGraph at pinned tag `v1.0` to `scripts/FlameGraph/`:
- If `scripts/FlameGraph/` does not exist: `git clone --depth=1 --branch v1.0`
- If it exists: `git fetch --tags --depth=1 && git checkout v1.0`

### `init check`

Run `env-check.sh` (or `env-check.ps1`) and verify:
- Node.js version (LTS or later)
- git availability
- FlameGraph presence at `scripts/FlameGraph/`
- npm deps installed (`node_modules/` exists)
- `.gitignore` has common patterns

## Design Principles

- **No circular dependencies on Node.js** — Bootstrap scripts use only bash or PowerShell. Node.js is installed BY the bootstrap.
- **nvm is additive, not destructive** — `nvm install --lts` installs alongside existing Node versions. `nvm use --lts` scopes to the current shell only. System default node is never touched.
- **`.nvmrc` for the project** — Written with `--lts` so `nvm use` auto-selects when entering the project directory.
- **Install scripts are full Ubuntu-style templates** — apt update → install packages → verify tools. Each platform follows the same structural pattern.
- **New platforms are appended** — When generating an installer, the dispatch entry is appended to `scripts/install.sh` *before* the final `esac`, never inserted mid-file (avoids merge conflicts).
- **User must confirm** — Any auto-generated installer is presented to the user for approval before writing to disk.
- **FlameGraph pinned at v1.0** — Tag is stable; pinned clones are idempotent.
- **`install.ps1` is WSL-only** — Not modified by this skill. Windows-native installer is a future extension.
- **env-check scripts output JSON** — Structured `{os, distro, version, codename, pkg_manager, shell, is_wsl, arch, node_version, nvm_version, git_version}` for AI agent consumption.
